            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 font-medium">Answer:
                There are a few common methods for selecting HTML elements using the DOM:
                <br>
                1.getElementById(): This method allows you to select an element based on its unique identifier.
                <br>
                2.addEventListener(): Attaches an event listener to an element, allowing it to respond to user
                interactions like clicks and key presses.
                <br>

                3.getElementsByTagName(): This method allows you to select one or more elements based on their tag name.
                <br>
                4.querySelector(): This method allows you to select an element based on a CSS selector.
                <br>
                5.querySelectorAll(): Selects all elements that match a specified CSS selector.
                <br>
                6.getElementsByClassName(): This method allows you to select one or more elements based on their class
                name.
                <br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Question 3</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">What is event bubble?</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 font-medium">Answer: Event Bubble is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model).
                It happens when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up (or you can say is transmitted
                or propagated) to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.

            <h2 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Question 4</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">What is a callback function and why will you use it?</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 font-medium">Answer:
                A simple explanation of callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is designed to be
                executed at a specific time, such as when a particular event occurs or when a long-running task
                completes. The key idea behind a callback function is that it allows you to pass executable code as
                data, providing a way for the calling function to dynamically specify the behavior that should be
                executed at a later time. </p>
